### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description
This is a nanodegree projects from Udacity. Where I used Python to understand U.S. bikeshare data, calculated statistics and built an interactive environment for user to choose the data and filter for a database to analyze.

The code I submitted should be able to support the following features:

-Load the data among three cities
-Filter the data by month
-Filter tue data by day of week
-Display key stats (time, station, trip duration, user stats)
-View raw data by every 5 rows
-Washington data does not have gender and birth year columns. When the user selects washington as the city you need to skip analysis related with gender and birth year.

### Files used
